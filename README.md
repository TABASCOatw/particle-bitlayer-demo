    Particle Network BTC Connect Bitlayer Demo
  </h3>
</div>

‚ö°Ô∏è Demo application showcasing the implementation of Particle Network's BTC Connect product on Bitlayer, the first Bitcoin security-equivalent L2 based on BitVM. This demo onboards a user through a Bitcoin-native wallet (such as UniSat, OKX, TokenPocket, Bybit, or Bitget), assigns a smart account (on Bitlayer), and executes a gasless burn transaction.

Built using **BTC Connect (by Particle Network)**, **TypeScript**

## ‚Çø BTC Connect
BTC Connect takes advantage of ERC-4337 alongside (Bitcoin) Layer-2 EVM-compatible blockchains to leverage a Smart Account, Paymaster, Bundler natively within Bitcoin wallets (connected to through a Bitcoin-specific modal also provided by BTC Connect). As its core, BTC Connect enables existing BTC wallets to control smart accounts on Layer-2s.
